What Tron is doing...

AT PREP STAGE

1. Gather client info (First/Last Name, password for autologin, if need a/v or not.)

2. Map Beast to drive (a: ? t: ?)

3. Copy files from \\BEAST\Documents\Clean Up to Desktop of current user in the folder "CleanTechTemp"

4. Makes a sub-directory of CleanTechTemp labelled lastname-firstname-yyyy-mm-dd (further known as CLIENTDIR)

5. Launches SecuritySoftView to allow user to manually look for active A/V that could cause problems with registry imports/edits

6. Backs up registry keys that may get overwritten to CLIENTDIR .reg files

7. Creates a pre-clean restore point

8. Turns off UAC temporarily to make automatically launching elevated progs quicker (no prompt) via registry edits

9. Sets autologon on temporarily via registry edits

10. Dumps pre-clean system info to CLIENTDIR in dated .nfo files (viewable in Windows)

11. Pre-emptively rebuilds performance counters to utilize for perfmoance metrics

12. Runs a perfmon preset, saving logs temporarily to C:\CleanTech\

13. Prepares next stage by setting next batch file to run at startup with client details passed as options

14. Starts BootTimer to grab bootup time metric

AT STARTCLEAN STAGE

1. Waits for BootTimer to display bootup time, then grabs displayed time and places it in dated file in CLIENTDIR

2. Force closes BootTimer's annoying extra cmd window and webpage

3. Launches ADWCleaner, needs user input to scan (Will do this automatically in the future)

4. Launces PC-Decrapifer, needs user input to observe and handle removal of bloatware.

5. Sets PC to reboot into safe mode and next batch file to auto start with Windows shell (Be not afraid, this is reset early in the next batch file)

6. Reboots into safemode for TRON stage.

AT TRON STAGE

1. Resets shell registry entry (no more lack of taskbar, et. al)

2. Starts Tron in non-interactive mode (flags set -a -str -sdb -sdc)

3. Sets next boot back to normal, with yet another batch file, and reboots

AT FINISH STAGE

1. Lies to end-user, this isn't the end.

2.
